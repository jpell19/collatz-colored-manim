<p style="text-align: center;">The example above shows just the odd numbers in the 3x+1 Collatz sequence starting at <em>85</em> before collapsing to <em>1</em> in binary.  The height of the rectangles represent bit's exponent where the solid rectangle bits represenet even powers of 2 and the hollow bits represent odd powers.</p>
